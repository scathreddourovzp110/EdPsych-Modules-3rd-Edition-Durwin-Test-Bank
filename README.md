  * Now with SAGE Publications, Cheryl Cisero Durwin and Marla Reese-Weber’s EdPsych Modules uses an innovative implementation of case studies and a modular format to address the challenge of effectively connecting theory and research to practice.  Each module is a succinct, stand-alone topic that represents every subject found in traditional chapter texts and can be used in any order for maximum flexibility in organizing your course.  Each of the book’s eight units of modules begins with a set of four case studies–early childhood, elementary, middle school, and secondary–and ends with "Assess" and "Reflect and Evaluate" questions and activities to encourage comprehension and application of the research and theories presented. The case approach and the extensive pedagogy that support it allows students to constantly see the applications of the theories and research that they are studying in the text.
